			<h2>Ooty</h2>
			
			
			<p> Ooty is a hill station in Tamil Nadu. You can reach Ooty by bus, tain or flight. You will get to know that you are about to reach Ooty when you feel cold and need your sweater/ jacket. Just pull it on, feel the cold and see the beauty of the place.Once you reach, just grab a cup of tea and feel taste of tea made in Ooty. Grab some tea cakes as well.</p>
			<p>Doddabetta View Point offers beautiful view of Ooty. It is just a small climb and you could see some really good view from different angles. After this, you could go to Eagle Dare Adventure and try zip lining and other adventurous activities. Visit the Tea Factory and Chocolate Factory and try the different varities of tea and chocolates that they offer. Consider buying some tea/ chocolates if you like. You could also ride horses when you come out of the factories. Next is the Botanical Garden where you could roam around for miles by enjoying the breathtaking view offered by the majestic gardens. Sunset is the best fom Rose Garden where you could also see the packed colourful houses of Ooty. You could end the day after doing some shopping in the Tibetan Market.</p>
			<p> Next day morning, try to catch the Lovedale Toy Train 9you have to book the tickets in advance) and then walk through the Ooty Pine Forest and Lake. Boat House TTDC offers boaing and other rides, there's a toy train ride here if you missed the actual one in Lovedale. Walk around the markets and buy bakery items that you like - tea cakes were my favorites!
