Let us take a look at some of the good places you can visit if you are in and near Kozhikode Town.</p>
			<h2>Kozhikode Beach </h2>
			<p> The Kozhikode Beach is a must visit place. As you enter the beach itself, you are sure to notice I love Kozhikode photo point. From there, you can see many small shops where you could try the local street food. Cherandi ice is quite famous, so do not leave the place without trying it! Then you can moe forward to the Freedom Square which is good way to know about the freedom struggles in Kozhikode. The place is lit at night and is beautiful to watch at night. Next to this square, there will some sort of programmes always happening. So, if you are watching someone who wants to watch these, you can spend a good time listening and watching the programs. Then if you walk a further more, you can take a walk in the sea wall. Try to grab some food from the famous "Adamnte Chaya Kada" as well!</p>
			<h2>Mittayi Theruv, S. M. Street </h2>
			<p> Love shopping at a cheap price? You are at the right place. There are so many sellers and if you are good at bargaining, you can grab a good amount of goods at a cheap price. Plus, there are lots of shops to buy from if you are not happy with the bargained price. Spices, clothes, athar (perfumes), jewellery, toys, accessories, food n drinks - you name it and and you have it here. The famous "Kozhikodan Halwa" can also be bought frm here. Taste the different flavors and buy them if you like it! There are shops which provide pan India delivery as well.</p>
			<h2>Sarovaram Bio Park</h2>		
			<p>The Sarovaram Bio Park is not an upto the mark Bio Park. The entrance is great. You can buy a ticket which costs just 20 rupees to enter the place. Photography and videography costs extra. There are built in paths where you can walk and many sitting area to rest. There is a small park as well. But the place is not something you can visit with your family along with children as the place is mostly filled with lovers in almost every nook and corner.
