			<p>Nisargadhama Bamboo Forest, Coorg is a picturesque picnic spot near Kushalnagar in the district of Kodagu in Karnataka.</p>
			<p>If one has been to the Namdroling Monastery, then this is a nearby place you do not want to miss. One can find lush foliage of thick bamboo groves, sandalwood and teak trees. There are deer, rabbits, peacocks and a children's playground as well as an orchidarium.</p>
			<p> I dropped by here in the evening and it was wonderful. There are lots of ride over here and you can get discounts if you get in as a gang of people. You can walk through the paths set in the forest and can find deers, tree houses and actually climb into the tree houses as well. Some time after I got inside the forest, it started raining. Luckily, for me, I had my umbrella in my bag and then I moved around the place with water all over. It was nice to move around and you can take some really cool pictures as well.</p>
			<p> There is a river and you can get into the water at a few shallow and safe points. I didn't as I was busy exploring the land. Futher, there are elepghant rides and boating facilities available if you would like to try them.
