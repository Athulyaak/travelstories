			<p>Malpe is a natural port in the Udupi District in Karnataka, India. It is also known as the largest fishing harbour in the Udupi District.</p>
			<p>Malpe Beach is known as a destination for holidays and picnics. The Beach has a Sea Walkway with a view of St. Mary's Island and Bhadargad Island, as well as the rest of the beach. The pic shows the entrance of Malpe beach. There are many water games, rides and activities in this beach. Some of the activities you could do is go for a banana ride or ride a four-wheeler in the beach sand and so on. </p>
			<p>I got a boat ride to St. Mary's Island. There is a lot of things to explore in this island. You can move around to any place, climb the rocks, see different types of creatures. I basically saw six different sea creatures. You could see a lot of crabs, and many others things, which I don't know the name of! </p><p>If you feel thirsty, you could get some coconut water and rest at the resting place. These people come in the morning to sell different items and leave in the last boat to the beach. If you could, support the local business as well. I explored majority of the island, except some of the places which were restricted and this was a good experience too. Then a boat came and I returned to the beach. During this sailing, I got to see the sunset and sure it was a candy to my eyes! I have included a picture of that as well.
