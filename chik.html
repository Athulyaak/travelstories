			<p>Chikmagalur, known officially as Chikkamagaluru, is a city and the headquarters of Chikmagalur district in the Indian state of Karnataka. Located on the foothills of the Mullayanagiri peak of the Western Ghats, the city attracts tourists from around the state for its pleasant and favourable hill station climate, tropical rainforest and coffee estates. To the north is Baba Budangiri, a mountain range in the Western Ghats, with 3 large caves said to be holy. Trails through forests and grasslands lead up to Mullayanagiri Peak. </p>
			<p> Chikmaglur is a hill station and Mullayanagiri Peak is the highest point of Karnataka. I would say that this was the best part of my trip. I started in the morning and reached the place by noon. I travelled to Mullayanagiri Peak in Jeep and that was the best part of the trekking. All the way, the view is breath-taking. You could see the clouds as you get higher and higher. Once you reach Mullayanagiri, the Jeep is stopped and you can climb to the highest point in Karnataka.</p>
			<p> I started climbing through the steps. You could try climbing through the hill as well. However, I considered it to be safe to climb through the stairs. When I reached the top, it was about 4 o' clock. I took a view to the base of the hill and I loved it! I took a pic and you can see it above. You can see that all the vehicles parked below and hopefully, the stairs too. In the peak, there is a temple and I got into there as well, the top! Then I got out and explored the sideways.I got down a little bit and stayed there for a while. It's good to breathe in fresh air from there, you feel very connected to nature. There is an incription saying that it's the topmost most point in Karnataka. Some people take a pic from there and that's something to be proud of!</p>
			<p>From there, I went off road to Mullayanagiri hills. It was already evening and as I climbed, fog started to surround the place. It was so cold and such a happy feeling. You are midst fog, you are actually in paradise! I went deeper and after sometime while returning, the only source of light was flash of mobile phones. You won't be able to see anyone. That was so cool! I would not trade that feeling for anything! I suggest you to have it as well. I returned to where my jeep was parked and we took off, off road. This is called trekking!
