			<p>The Chennakeshava Temple is a 12th-century Hindu temple in the Hassan district of the Indian state Karnataka. It was commissioned by King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 CE, on the banks of the Yagachi River in Belur also called Velapura, an early Hoysala Empire capital. The temple was built over three generations and took 103 years to finish. The Chennakeshava is a form of Lord Vishnu and so the temple is referred to Keshava or Kesava as well.</p>
			<p> The temple is remarkable for its architecture, sculptures, reliefs, friezes as well its iconography, inscriptions and history. You can see some of the sculptures as well, in the pics I took during my visit. The stone works made me wonder about the skill the people had back then and you would praise it as well if you go there and see how marvelous the temple really is. The floor actually has stone as interlock tiles. I visited the place at noon and I had doubts if the stone would be very hot and if I would get my feet burned (You have to remove your footwear before you enter the temple). But since it rained before I got there, the stone was very cool and it felt really nice to explore the whole place.</p>
			<p> Once you get outside, you may consider buying some of the stone sculptures kept for sale. You could support the local business this way.
