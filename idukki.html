			<p>Think of hills? Think of Idukki! The whole place is hilly with Dams, lakes, pine forests, tea plantations, gardens etc. Vagamon, Paruthumpara, Panchalimedu are very good places for an excursion. </p>
			<h2>Vagamon </h2>
			<p> You have surely heard of this place if you have browsed for the places to visit in Idukki. The place is vibrant, hilly and of course green. THere are greeny meadows which the locals call as "Motta Kunnu" meaning Egg hills. They are of short height and many are packed like Easter eggs. The whole area is green, it is sure to make your mood pleasant and I feel, a very good picinic spot with family. There is a lake where you could go kayaking and some small parks in which kids are sure to enjoy themselves in different rides. I must say that the winds are of high speed so make sure you catch your caps as the winds take them away while you pose for pictures. Pine forest is the next best attraction. There are lots of pine trees as you ascend the pine valley. If you are brave enough to explore the place, then you should try finding some good pine cones. Pine corns last - A sweet and inexpensive trophy to take back home for memories. There are small shops in the foot of the pine valley. You could try different types of tea like Ginger tea, Lemon tea etc.</p>
			<h2>Paruthumpara </h2>
			<p> A very good place to visit. There are lots of "Para" meaning rocks which make up th "Paruthumpara". You can park your vehciles and do a little shopping or if you adventourous enough, then either ascend to the top or descend to the bottom and find the Suicide Point. There is a designed path to go to the top, which is well paved and has umbrellas ocassionally to save you from the heat. If you want to ascend down and go to the suicide point, then it is sure that you will treat your eyes a great sight. The path to the point itself is actually narrow. One wrong step an you are gone forever. Riders come here and go through this path and find themselves in the point - angels protect them! I would recommend you to first do the adventure you want to do and then come back and treat yourself a special Kuluki Sarbath! Its worth every penny!</p>
			<h2>Panchalimedu </h2>		
			<p> I assume Panchalimedu is not that famous, atleat as much as Vagamon. Th place is beautiful with a stone made structure like the Belur temple but only to find a shop inside, not a deity. There is a small entry fee you have to pay to enter inside and its totally worth if you could watch the sunset after moving further forward. The place is well maintained and you will find yourself resting among the lush green grass. If you want to take a small walk and then rest, you could find many benches along the way. But make sure you go father and farther until you reach a point where you will be left only with the view, I call it " Heaven". Yes, after a while if you look up, you will see the heaven. Walk further and enjoy the sunset for a while, energize yourself and come back to the starting point by taking a right deviation through the road like path. You have seen the whole place. One strange thing about this place is that on one side you will find many crosses representing Christainity and on the other side you will find temples representing Hinduism. The path is what separates them both!
